        <!--
            TO DO:

            Bugs:
            Find alternative for "which" methods (depreciated) [super very extra low-priority]
            Crossword doesn't deselect when clicking outside of it (leads to unintentional editing of crosssword when using other parts of the site.)

            About Page:
            Make an about page
            
            Creator:
            Add UI to create custom crossword sizes (currently only available through console functions)
            Create automatic error checkers
            Add cookie to autosave current crossword
            ^ Add UI to clear current crossword (and an extra pop-up confirmation)
            
            Player:
            Add UI to show the current hints for the word
            (Maybe) add auto-check/reveal answer (disables the crossword counting but keeps name in finished crosswords list)
            {Waiting on a sufficient number of crosswords} Create crossword-of-the-day (possibly supplied through external server, or could be done locally through date seeded number algorithm)

            Network:
            Set up server for automatic uploading and sharing of crosswords via external server (Keep local files as failsafe)
